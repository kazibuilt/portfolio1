Data protection at a glance</strong></h2><h3 class="h3"><strong>General information</strong></h3><p class="basic-paragraph">The following notes provide a simple overview of what happens to your personal data when you visit this website. Personal data is any data by which you can be personally identified. For more detailed information on data protection, please refer to our privacy policy listed below this text.<br/></p><h3 class="h3"><strong>Data collection on this website<br/></strong></h3><h4 class="heading"><strong>Who is responsible for data collection on this website?</strong></h4><p class="basic-paragraph">Data processing on this website is carried out by the website operator. You can find his contact details in the section &quot;Note on the responsible party&quot; in this data protection declaration.<br/></p><h4 class="heading"><strong>How do we collect your data?</strong></h4><p class="basic-paragraph">On the one hand, your data is collected by you providing it to us. This can be, for example, data that you enter in a contact form.<br/>‍<br/>Other data is collected automatically or after your consent when you visit the website by our IT systems. This is mainly technical data (e.g. Internet browser, operating system or time of page view). This data is collected automatically as soon as you enter this website.<br/></p><h4 class="heading"><strong class="bold-text">What do we use your data for?</strong></h4><p class="basic-paragraph">Some of the data is collected to ensure error-free provision of the website. Other data may be used to analyze your user behavior.<br/></p><h4 class="heading"><strong class="bold-text">What rights do you have regarding your data?</strong></h4><p class="basic-paragraph">You have the right at any time to receive information free of charge about the origin, recipient and purpose of your stored personal data. You also have a right to request the correction or deletion of this data. If you have given your consent to data processing, you can revoke this consent at any time for the future. You also have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data under certain circumstances. Furthermore, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory authority.<br/><br/>For this purpose, as well as for further questions on the subject of data protection, you can contact us at any time.<br/></p><h2 class="h2"><strong>2. Hosting</strong></h2><p class="basic-paragraph">We host the contents of our website with the following provider:<br/></p><h3 class="h3"><strong>Webflow</strong></h3><p class="basic-paragraph">The provider is Webflow, Inc., 398 11th Street, 2nd Floor, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA (hereinafter referred to as Webflow). When you visit our website, Webflow collects various log files including your IP addresses.<br/><br/>Webflow is a tool for creating and hosting websites. Webflow stores cookies or other recognition technologies that are necessary for the display of the page, to provide certain website functions and to ensure security (necessary cookies).<br/><br/>For details, see Webflow&#x27;s privacy policy:<br/>https://webflow.com/legal/eu-privacy-policy.<br/><br/>The use of Webflow is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO. We have a legitimate interest in the most reliable presentation of our website. Insofar as a corresponding consent has been requested, the processing is carried out exclusively on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a DSGVO and § 25 para. 1 TTDSG, insofar as the consent includes the storage of cookies or access to information in the user&#x27;s terminal device (e.g. device fingerprinting) as defined by the TTDSG. The consent can be revoked at any time.<br/><br/>Data transfer to the USA is based on the standard contractual clauses of the EU Commission. Details can be found here:<br/>https://webflow.com/legal/eu-privacy-policy.<br/></p><h4 class="heading"><strong class="bold-text">Order processing</strong></h4><p class="basic-paragraph">We have concluded a contract on order processing (AVV) for the use of the above service. This is a contract required by data protection law, which ensures that this processes the personal data of our website visitors only according to our instructions and in compliance with the DSGVO.<br/></p><h2 class="h2"><strong>3. General notes and mandatory information</strong></h2><h3 class="h3"><strong>Data protection</strong></h3><p class="basic-paragraph">The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy.<br/><br/>When you use this website, various personal data are collected. Personal data is data with which you can be personally identified. This privacy policy explains what data we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and for what purpose this is done.<br/><br/>We would like to point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g. when communicating by e-mail) can have security gaps. Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.<br/></p><h3 class="h3"><strong>Note on the responsible party</strong></h3><p class="basic-paragraph">The responsible party for data processing on this website is:<br/><br/>Samuel Christian Siebler <br/>Brüsseler Straße 77 <br/>50672 Cologne<br/>‍<br/>Phone: 0176/92158095<br/>E-mail: samuelsiebler@gmail.com<br/><br/>The controller is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data (e.g., name, e-mail address, contact details, etc.).<br/></p><h3 class="h3"><strong>Storage period</strong></h3><p class="basic-paragraph">Unless a more specific storage period has been stated within this privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for processing the data no longer applies. If you assert a legitimate request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g. retention periods under tax or commercial law); in the latter case, the data will be deleted once these reasons no longer apply.<br/></p><h3 class="h3"><strong>General information on the legal basis for data processing on this website</strong></h3><p class="basic-paragraph">If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) DSGVO or Art. 9(2)(a) DSGVO, if special categories of data are processed in accordance with Art. 9(1) DSGVO. In the case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, the data processing is also based on Art. 49 (1) a DSGVO. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to the access to information in your terminal device (e.g. via device fingerprinting), the data processing is additionally carried out on the basis of Section 25 (1) TTDSG. The consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is required for the performance of a contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, we process your data on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b DSGVO. Furthermore, if your data is required for the fulfillment of a legal obligation, we process it on the basis of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c DSGVO. Furthermore, the data processing may be carried out on the basis of our legitimate interest according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO. Information about the relevant legal basis in each individual case is provided in the following paragraphs of this privacy policy.<br/></p><h3 class="h3"><strong>Note on data transfer to the USA and other third countries</strong></h3><p class="basic-paragraph">Among other things, we use tools from companies based in the USA or other third countries that are not secure under data protection law. If these tools are active, your personal data may be transferred to these third countries and processed there. We would like to point out that no level of data protection comparable to that in the EU can be guaranteed in these countries. For example, US companies are obliged to hand over personal data to security authorities without you as a data subject being able to take legal action against this. It can therefore not be ruled out that US authorities (e.g. intelligence services) process, evaluate and permanently store your data located on US servers for monitoring purposes. We have no influence on these processing activities.<br/></p><h3 class="h3"><strong>Revocation of your consent to data processing</strong></h3><p class="basic-paragraph">Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke consent you have already given at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.<br/></p><h3 class="h3"><strong>Right to object to data collection in special cases and to direct marketing (Art. 21 DSGVO).</strong></h3><p class="basic-paragraph">IF DATA PROCESSING IS CARRIED OUT ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6 ABS. 1 LIT. E OR F DSGVO, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AT ANY TIME FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING WHICH OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS, OR THE PROCESSING IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF ASSERTING, EXERCISING OR DEFENDING LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION UNDER ART. 21 PARA. 1 DSGVO).IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA ARE PROCESSED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT MARKETING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH MARKETING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING INSOFAR AS IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT MARKETING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT ADVERTISING (OBJECTION IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE 21 (2) OF THE GERMAN DATA PROTECTION ACT).<br/></p><h3 class="h3"><strong>Right of appeal to the competent supervisory authority</strong></h3><p class="basic-paragraph">In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects shall have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of their habitual residence, their place of work or the place of the alleged violation. The right of appeal is without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy.<br/></p><h3 class="h3"><strong>Right to data portability</strong></h3><p class="basic-paragraph">You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in performance of a contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of the data to another responsible party, this will only be done insofar as it is technically feasible.<br/></p><h3 class="h3"><strong>Information, correction and deletion</strong></h3><p class="basic-paragraph">Within the framework of the applicable legal provisions, you have the right at any time to free information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipient and the purpose of data processing and, if necessary, a right to correction or deletion of this data. For this purpose, as well as for further questions on the subject of personal data, you can contact us at any time.<br/></p><h3 class="h3"><strong>Right to restriction of processing</strong></h3><p class="basic-paragraph">You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. For this purpose, you can contact us at any time. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:- If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the review, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.<br/>‍<br/>- If the processing of your personal data happened/is happening unlawfully, you can request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.<br/>- If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it to exercise, defend or assert legal claims, you have the right to request restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of erasure.<br/>- If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21 (1) DSGVO, a balancing of your and our interests must be carried out. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.<br/><br/>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data - apart from its storage - may only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of an important public interest of the European Union or a Member State.<br/></p><h3 class="h3"><strong>SSL or TLS encryption</strong></h3><p class="basic-paragraph">For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or requests that you send to us as the site operator, this site uses SSL or TLS encryption. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from &quot;http://&quot; to &quot;https://&quot; and by the lock symbol in your browser line.<br/><br/>If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.<br/></p><h2 class="h2"><strong>4. data collection on this website</strong></h2><h3 class="h3"><strong>Inquiry by e-mail, telephone or fax</strong></h3><p class="basic-paragraph">If you contact us by e-mail, telephone or fax, your inquiry including all resulting personal data (name, inquiry) will be stored and processed by us for the purpose of processing your request. We do not pass on this data without your consent.<br/><br/>The processing of this data is based on Art. 6 (1) lit. b DSGVO, if your request is related to the performance of a contract or is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing of the requests sent to us (Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO) or on your consent (Art. 6 (1) (a) DSGVO) if this has been requested; the consent can be revoked at any time.<br/><br/>The data you send to us via contact requests will remain with us until you request us to delete it, revoke your consent to store it or the purpose for storing the data no longer applies (e.g. after your request has been processed). Mandatory legal provisions - in particular legal retention periods - remain unaffected.<br/><br/>Source:<br/>https://www.e-recht24.de<br/></p></div><script src="https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/js/jquery-3.5.1.min.dc5e7f18c8.js?site=64014e7f745e5f2127dad049" type="text/javascript" integrity="sha256-9/aliU8dGd2tb6OSsuzixeV4y/faTqgFtohetphbbj0=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/64014e7f745e5f2127dad049/js/webflow.265e3947f.js" type="text/javascript"></script><style>
